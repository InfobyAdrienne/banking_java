# Banking in Java 

This beginner-friendly project creates a bank account application using the Java programming language. The application greets the user and asks them which function they would like to perform. The options are:

1. Check balance
2. Make deposit
3. Make withdrawal 
4. View previous transaction
5. Calculate interest
6. Exit the application

This is a great introductory to object-oriented programming (OOP) because we create a class called Account that we interact with.
